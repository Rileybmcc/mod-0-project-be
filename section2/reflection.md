## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Sleeping on a problem when working late at night resonated strongly with me because i have a tendency to stay up late while trying to find a solution.   
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* When I look at new material before learning it or even while learning I sometimes feel like I'm not smart enough, especially when others around me grasp it more easily.  I'm working on being more open when I struggle and on asking for help.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
* A conditional statement is also known as an if then statement.
* If tommorow is Christmas then today is Christmas Eve.
* If I'm hungry then I will go eat food.
* If I have two pets and the dog is inside, the cat must be outside.
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
* You would use it if there are two or three possible outcomes.
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
* if, then, elsif, end
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
* I used && to connect possible outcomes.
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

random_num = 7

if random_num > 9
  p "Face card"
  elsif random_num = 8
  p "Split them"
  else
  p "Small card"
  end
