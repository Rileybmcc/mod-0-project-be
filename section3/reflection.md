## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
 * I found myself getting frustrated less often.  
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
 * I didn't always want to take my break because I was in the middle of something but I think I was more effecient when I finished my line and stepped away.
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
 * Hash allows you to reference data not just as the position in the array but can be assigned to strings.
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

pet_store = {
  "Dog food" => 24,
  "Cat food" => 7,
  "Bones" => 15
  "Leash" => 6
}
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
 * puts states["IA"]
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
p states.keys
p states.values
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
 * Use a hash when you'd like to refer to variables instead of numbers.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
